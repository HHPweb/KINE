	<h4>Bhibha M. Das, Ph.D., M.P.H., Physical Activity Promotion Concentration Coordinator</h4>
	
	<p>
		Bhibha Das earned a bachelor degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a master in Public Health from University of Illinois at Springfield, and a doctorate in Kinesiology and Community Health from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She completed her post-doctoral training at the University of Georgia, in the lab of Dr. Ellen Evans. Prior to her academic career, Bhibha worked in the field of public health, first at the Illinois Department of Public Health and then at Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Dr. Das believes that it is a public health priority to develop translatable, community-based interventions that are not only effective but also easily disseminated and sustainable. Her research agenda emphasizes the development, implementation, and evaluation of cost-effective and sustainable weight management and physical activity promotion interventions. By utilizing community-based participator approach along with mixed methodology (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) as part of her research, Dr. Das&apos; current research focuses on worksites, college campuses, and underserved populations.
	</p>
	
	<p>Past Studies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Invisible Employee (PI) - examined physical activity barriers in university housekeeping and grounds employees</li>
		<li>ECU Healthy Lifestyles Project (PI) - examined the effect of a hybrid (i.e., in-person coaching plus social media) intervention delivery mechanism on weight management behaviors (e.g., physical activity and diet) for office employees</li>
		<li>Assessing Kinesiology Students&apos; Perceptions of the Senior Games (PI) - examined kinesiology students&apos; perceptions of older adults through the lens of the Senior Games</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Current Studies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pirates for HEALTH: Healthy Eating, Active Living Through Health Coaching (PI) - examine the effect of three intervention delivery mechanisms on weight management behaviors (e.g., physical activity and diet) for university employees</li>
		<li>Healthcare Providers&apos; Barriers to Physical Activity Prescription (PI) - examine healthcare providers&apos; barriers to prescribing physical activity to their patients</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Dr. Das serves as the Physical Activity Promotion Concentration Coordinator and teaches KINE 4030: Physical Activity and Aging.</p>

	<h4>Katrina D. DuBose, Ph.D.</h4>
	
	<p>
		Originally from Toledo, Ohio, Dr. DuBose completed her Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science from the University of Toledo. As part of her degree, she completed a study that compared the Rockport Walking and Cooper Walk/Run Fitness Tests. She received her Master and Doctoral degrees from the University of South Carolina. Both degrees were in Exercise Physiology; however, during her doctoral degree she earned a minor in Epidemiology. Her graduate thesis focused on the relationship between physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and lipoprotein(a) in women. Her dissertation used NHANES data to examine the relationship between physical activity and the metabolic syndrome in adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		After earning her PhD, Dr. DuBose completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the Center for Physical Activity and Weight Management at the University of Kansas. During this fellowship, she ran a three-year elementary school physical activity intervention. The goal of this project was to use physical activity as a way to prevent obesity in children and increase their physical activity levels. Given her diverse back ground in exercise physiology, epidemiology, and public health the best term that describes her is a Physical Activity Epidemiologist.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr. DuBose&apos;s primary research goal is to promote health in children and adults through physical activity. Specific areas of interest include using physical activity as a preventive and treatment method for childhood obesity. She is also interested in the role physical activity has in reducing the risk for the metabolic syndrome. Past works have employed the use of cross-sectional and intervention study designs along with analysis of secondary data sources, such as NHANES, to examine the effect of physical activity on obesity and the metabolic syndrome.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr. DuBose teaches both at the undergraduate and graduate level. Courses taught include: KINE 3800/3801: Measurement of Physical Activity and Fitness and Lab; KINE 3802: Obesity Prevention and Treatment; KINE 4115/6115: Physical Activity and Public Health.
