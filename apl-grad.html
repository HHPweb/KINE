	<p>
		Physical Activity Promotion Concentration graduate students will acquire an understanding of measurement, determinants, and outcomes of physical activity. The major focus of the program is on promotion of lifestyle physical activity in children, adults, and older adults in a variety of settings. Graduates of the program will be well-prepared to continue graduate study in measurement of physical activity, epidemiology, and public health and to work in settings where they develop and deliver policy regarding physical activity, manage physical activity facilities, or promote physically active lifestyles with non-clinical populations.
