	<h4>Vision:</h4>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">Inclusive dance for children as a creative dance experience.</p>

	<h4>Major Goals:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Foster creative expression &amp; dance skills beyond current expectations</li>
		<li>Elevate self- confidence and respect as well as improve physical strength and balance</li>
		<li>Provide multidisciplinary service learning opportunities for ECU students</li>
		<li>Transform community perceptions and attitudes about disabilities</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Origins of the Program:</h4>
	<p>In 2009, Dr. Boni Boswell completed the DanceAbility Teacher Certification Program in Finland. However Dr. Boswell&apos;s interest and expertise in providing the world with inclusive dance environments and sharing the energizing and restorative power of dance has been the hallmark of her career. Still, the certification process and her involvement with DanceAbility International sparked an even more determined effort. With colleagues, Bomna Ko, PhD and Jennifer Rezeli, MA, she has built the foundation of a program that will challenge assumptions of our community and inspire creativity and build dance skills of our children through dance.</p>
