	<p><strong>Vision:</strong> </p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">Inclusive dance for children as a creative dance experience.</p>
	<p><strong>Major Goals:</strong></p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">Foster creative expression beyond current expectations for children with and without disabilities</p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">Promote physical strength and balance</p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">Provide multidisciplinary service learning opportunities for ECU students</p>
	<p><strong>Origins of the Program:</strong></p>
	<p>In 2009, Dr. Boni Boswell completed the DanceAbility Teacher Certification Program in Finland. However Dr. Boswell&apos;s interest and expertise in providing the world with inclusive dance environments and sharing the energizing and restorative power of dance has been the hallmark of her career. Still, the certification process and her involvement with DanceAbility International sparked an even more determined effort. With colleagues, Bomna Ko, PhD  and Erica Brinson, she has built the foundations of a program that will challenge assumptions and inspire creativity through movement arts.</p>
