<p class="interests"><strong>Research Interests:</strong><br />
	 As the physical inactivity epidemic continues, it is a public health priority to develop translatable, community-based interventions that can be disseminated and sustained. Using my public health practitioner background, my research agenda emphasizes the development, implementation, and evaluation of cost-effective and sustainable physical activity and chronic disease management interventions. I utilize mixed methods (i.e., qualitative and quantitative techniques), community-based participatory approach, and evaluation as part of my research agenda, which currently focuses on worksites and underserved populations.</p>
