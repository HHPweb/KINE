<p class="interests"><strong>Research Interests:</strong><br />
	 The primary goal of my research is to promote health in children and adults through physical activity. Some areas of interest include using physical activity as a preventive and treatment measure in childhood obesity. I am also interested in the role physical activity has in reducing the risk for the metabolic syndrome. I employ the use of cross-sectional and intervention study designs along with analysis of secondary data sources (such as, NHANES) to examine the effects of physical activity on obesity and the metabolic syndrome.</p>
