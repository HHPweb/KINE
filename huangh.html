	 Metabolic physiological activities including feeding behavior, body weight homeostasis, and glucose metabolism are critically regulated by different types of neurons located in hypothalamus of brain. Our laboratory seeks to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease regulated by central nervous system, and ultimately to develop effective and applicable preventive and treatment programs. To achieve this goal, we utilize a combination of mice genetic engineering techniques and biochemical approaches to investigate how central neurocircuits control food intake, energy expenditure and body weight homeostasis in response to exercise and diet. By understanding how neurons integrate diverse signals into consistent metabolic programs, we hope to identify the mechanisms by which integrated physiological processes are regulated and how these processes are disrupted in disease states.</p>
