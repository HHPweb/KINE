	<h4>General Research Directions</h4>
	<h5>Research examining physical activity experiences on motivation and well-being. </h5>
	<p>One current example is Project Mentor which is an on-going research project in which undergraduate students serve as a mentor and lifestyle coach for overweight adolescents. The program is designed to facilitate exercise success and enjoyment as well as to help adolescents develop self-regulatory skills that serve as the foundation for healthy eating and active lifestyles. Graduate students in Sport and Exercise Psychology have the opportunity to lead the program and train the mentors on effective exercise guidelines as well as on lifestyle coaching strategies. This not only provides graduate students the chance to apply what they are learning in the classroom but can also as a source of participants for their thesis work.  A second example includes studies on affective responses to exercise focused on gaining a better understanding of how to structure exercise to enhance enjoyment and improve affect/mood. A third example focuses on potential antecedents of burnout in organized sport given its impact on athlete well-being and motivation.</p>
	<h5>Visual Motor Laboratory</h5>
	<p>Research within VML involves projects that examine visual attention, arousal, mental workload, and attentional bias.  The goal of the VML research program is to understand how vision and cognition control and modulate behavior. This research is based on the use of eye movement recordings, biometrics, and psychophysiological recordings including EMG, EEG, and ECG as well as other measures to examine cognitive function in information rich environments. A secondary focus includes research to determine how visual search behavior influences motor dysfunction such as Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. At the core of the research is to investigate the links between the perceptual (processing) and motor systems (output).</p>
	<h5>Research examining physical activity among families:</h5>
	<p>The overall goal of this line of research is to improve the health, well-being, and quality of life among families through physical activity. This research is focused on understanding the determinants and patterns of physical activity among families in order to effectively promote this health behavior within the family unit. This is important as family structures have shifted over the past several decades and there are now many 'special populations' of families that have received relatively little attention within the physical activity literature (e.g., single mothers, single fathers, grandparent caregivers, etc.). These and other topics are explored using behavioral theories and a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) approach. </p>
